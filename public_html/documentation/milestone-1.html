		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>I would like my PWP to be a showcase of who I am as a person by presenting the projects I have completed both in
			real life and digitally. My time as a nurse, teacher, woodworker, coder, and gamer has made me into a highly
			technical, yet personable professional. I believe that by presenting elements from my life, perspective employers
			will see that investing in me provides more than just my experiences in a bootcamp, but also gives them access to
			15 years of problem-solving, creative solutions, and exuberant creativity, packaged in a way that is fun,
			engaging, and simplified for anyone to understand.</p>
	</div><!--end of Purpose block-->
	<div class="row"> <!--Audience block-->
		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<p>This website is designed for anyone who is looking for a competent problem solver to hire (for money!). This may
			include business owners looking to hire someone to build them a website, technical recruiters trying to put
			together a design team, or project managers who need to bring in a consultant on a project. Whomever it may be,
			this site assists them in filling their coding and problem-solving needs.</p>
	</div><!--end of Audience block-->
	<div class="row"> <!--Goal block-->
		<h3>Goal</h3>
		<p>This project will serve several purposes: serving as a monumental showcase of my work in an interactive way;
			showing prospective clients, employers, and partners who I am and what I bring to the table; and as an opportunity
			to stretch my mind with self-imposed coding challenges. All of these however go towards my main goal and reason
			for taking this bootcamp in the first place, to help me find gainful employment that is: outside public education;
			mentally stimulating without leaving me physically and emotionally exhausted at the end of the day; and provides
			just enough money to give myself, my wife, and our wonderful cats a life where our basic needs are met.</p>

	<h2>Persona</h2>
	<div class="row"><!--name-->
		<h3>Name</h3>
		<p>Bryan Butterworth</p>
		<h3>Age</h3>
		<p>58</p>
	</div><!--end of name-->
	<div class="row"> <!--description-->
		<h3>Profession</h3>
		<p>Bryan is a project manager for Webbo llc. a tech firm that that creates and maintains web applications. The
			company isn't in a great spot financially, so they've decided to take on contract work to cover costs. They just
			took on a contract job from hoopla.com, a much larger data processing company, to build the user interface for a
			survey website. Bryan has been with Webbo since they started up back in 2006. He considers himself tech-savvy with
			some prior coding experience but not a lot of time working as a developer. </p>
		<h4>Technology </h4>
		<ul class="list-group">
			<li class="list-group-item">A lenovo yoga 9 running windows 12</li>
			<li class="list-group-item">an apple Iphone pro 13 running iOS 15</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Attitudes and behaviors</h3>
		<p>Bryan doesn't keep up with new technology as much as he would like to. He's an older, 9-5 style manager with how
			he runs his projects but is trying to be more flexible. Bryan likes to see initiative in his team and tends to
			hire "go-getters" for projects. he still has a "knows a guy who knows a guy" style of networking and has never
			really enjoyed digging through job sites for possible candidates. </p>
	</div><!--end of description-->
	<div class="row"><!--frustrations-->
		<h3>Frustrations and needs</h3>
		<p> Bryan is looking to bring 1 or 2 jr developers onto his team to help meet the deadline that is quickly approaching. He recognizes that his team needs help keeping up with the small tasks that are taking up his higher level developers. he's willing to take a risk on new developers because his team just needs more manpower and the tasks he wants help with are relatively rote. His company is also facing money issues and the cfo has only approved bryan for 2 jr developer positions at most. He has put out emails to his contacts within the industry asking for recommendations and is getting back a lot of new graduates. He doesn't mind going through the applicants if it means finding someone who will be a good fit for the job, but he vastly prefers experience to education which is limiting his pool of applicants. </p>
	</div><!--end of frustrations-->
	<div class="row"><!--Goals-->
		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<p>Bryan is looking for developers with experience and practice, but haven't been tested in the industry yet. He is looking to hire brand-new graduates and immediately put them into the development team. He would like to see a body of work in front of the applicants and is not interested in someone who hasn't done some work on website design. </p>
