		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>I would like my PWP to be a showcase of who I am as a person by presenting the projects I have completed both in
			real life and digitally. My time as a nurse, teacher, woodworker, coder, and gamer has made me into a highly
			technical, yet personable professional. I believe that by presenting elements from my life, perspective employers
			will see that investing in me provides more than just my experiences in a bootcamp, but also gives them access to
			15 years of problem-solving, creative solutions, and exuberant creativity, packaged in a way that is fun,
			engaging, and simplified for anyone to understand.</p>
	</div><!--end of Purpose block-->
	<div class="row"> <!--Audience block-->
		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<p>This website is designed for anyone who is looking for a competent problem solver to hire (for money!). This may
			include business owners looking to hire someone to build them a website, technical recruiters trying to put
			together a design team, or project managers who need to bring in a consultant on a project. Whomever it may be,
			this site assists them in filling their coding and problem-solving needs.</p>
	</div><!--end of Audience block-->
	<div class="row"> <!--Goal block-->
		<h3>Goal</h3>
		<p>This project will serve several purposes: serving as a monumental showcase of my work in an interactive way;
			showing prospective clients, employers, and partners who I am and what I bring to the table; and as an opportunity
			to stretch my mind with self-imposed coding challenges. All of these however go towards my main goal and reason
			for taking this bootcamp in the first place, to help me find gainful employment that is: outside public education;
			mentally stimulating without leaving me physically and emotionally exhausted at the end of the day; and provides
			just enough money to give myself, my wife, and our wonderful cats a life where our basic needs are met.</p>
